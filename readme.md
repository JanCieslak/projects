### Website

Website is using a framework called Hugo. TODO: ...

TODO:

- Pass multiple arguments into wasm programs (generic solution - any number of args of any type)

### Zig + WASM

Zig + WASM based on Golang approach of interacting with website through WASM

TODO:

- Golang program: runOnChange.exe [where - pattern] [what - command], e.g. runOnChange.exe ./zig "zig build"
- Hot reload Vite on wasm change
- Better conosle.log
- General code refactor (TODOs, Shader, GLRenderer, etc.)
